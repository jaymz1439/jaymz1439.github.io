      <description>Helm 3.13 brings some significant and useful changes for Helm users. This ranges from longtime bugs being fixed to some new features that can have an impact on performance.&#xA;Dry-run &amp;amp; Template Can Connect To Servers The dry-run feature on install and upgrade, and Helm template has not been able to communicate with Kubernetes servers. This is for security and because Helm template was designed for template rendering alone.&#xA;With Helm 3.</description>

      <title>The Helm OCI MediaTypes</title>
      <link>https://jaymz1439.github.io/blog/helm-oci-mediatypes/</link>

      <description>Helm introduced full support for storing charts within OCI registries as a distribution method beginning in version 3.8, and while this feature has been available for some time now, there is more underneath the hood than one may realize to make this capability all possible. A number of concepts, working in unison, make it possible to store content aside from traditional container images within OCI registries. This article will explore one of these important concepts, Media Types, their purpose, and how Helm’s own set of Media Types make it possible to extend the storage of charts beyond standard chart repositories to OCI registries.</description>

      <title>Helm Completes Fuzzing Security Audit</title>
      <link>https://jaymz1439.github.io/blog/helm-completes-fuzzing-security-audit/</link>

      <guid>https://jaymz1439.github.io/blog/helm-completes-fuzzing-security-audit/</guid>
      <description>In the past year, the team at Ada Logics has worked on integrating continuous fuzzing into the Helm core project. This was an effort focused on improving the security posture of Helm and ensuring a continued good experience for Helm users. The fuzzing integration involved enrolling Helm in the OSS-Fuzz project and writing a set of fuzzers that further enriches the test coverage of Helm. In total, 38 fuzzers were written, and nine bugs were found (with eight fixed so far), demonstrating the work’s value for Helm both short term and long term.</description>

      <title>Helm 2 and the Charts Project Are Now Unsupported</title>

      <description>A year ago, we introduced Helm 3, a major evolution in Helm&#39;s development. And we announced at that time that Helm 2 would receive patches and security updates for a year.&#xA;Here we are, one year later. Friday the 13th, 2020 seems like a fitting day to end support for a major version. And today, we are announcing the official end of support for Helm 2. The charts repository is also now read-only, with no further changes.</description>

      <title>Helm Chart Repository Deprecation Update</title>

      <description>Back in 2019, when the Helm v2 support timeline and end of life plan was announced, the deprecation of the helm/charts GitHub repository was announced, as well. The primary reason for the deprecation is the significant increase in upkeep for the repo maintainers. Over the last couple of years the number of charts under maintainance increased from ~100 to 300+ causing a commensurate increase in pull requests and updates to the repo.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://helm.sh/blog/helm-turns-five/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;As previously announced&lt;/a&gt;, the stable and incubator repositories have moved to a new location. This post will update you on the new locations and provide directions to start using them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This does not affect the obsolescence timeline for the stable and incubator repositories that was announced in 2019. On November 13, 2020 the stable and incubator charts repository will reach the end of development and become archives. You can find that many of the charts have moved to other, community managed, repositories. You can discover these on the &#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://artifacthub.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Artifact Hub&lt;/a&gt;. More information on the obsolescence will follow in future blog posts and communications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The new location for the stable repository is &#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://charts.helm.sh/stable&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://charts.helm.sh/stable&lt;/a&gt; and the new location for the incubator repository is &#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://charts.helm.sh/incubator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://charts.helm.sh/incubator&lt;/a&gt;. If you use charts in either of these old locations below you MUST update the repositories you use before November 13, 2020. The new locations are hosted using GitHub pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;table&gt;&#xA;&lt;thead&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;th&gt;Old Location&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;th&gt;New Location&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;/thead&gt;&#xA;&lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;stable&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://charts.helm.sh/stable&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://charts.helm.sh/stable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;incubator&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes-charts-incubator.storage.googleapis.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://kubernetes-charts-incubator.storage.googleapis.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://charts.helm.sh/incubator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://charts.helm.sh/incubator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Along with the new locations, Helm v2.17.0 and v3.4.0 have been released to help you use the new location. You are encouraged to upgrade to the latest versions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With a streamlined client-only experience, a renewed focus on security, and tighter integration with Kubernetes APIs, Helm v3 continues to provide production-tested package management for Kubernetes. And as a &#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jaymz1439.github.io/blog/celebrating-helms-cncf-graduation/&#34;&gt;graduated CNCF project&lt;/a&gt;, Helm is a key part of the cloud native ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We recognize that rolling out a major version change in production requires time. The Helm maintainers committed to providing bugfixes for Helm v2 until May 2020 (which they &#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jaymz1439.github.io/blog/covid-19-extending-helm-v2-bug-fixes/&#34;&gt;extended to August 2020&lt;/a&gt;) and security patches for Helm v2 until November 2020.

      <description>Today we are happy to see Helm reach the final stage of the CNCF ladder. Helm has moved from the incubating level to the graduated level as a CNCF project, alongside Kubernetes and other select projects.&#xA;Given Helm&#39;s humble beginnings as a hackathon project at Deis, a small startup, we are ecstatic to see our little baby all grown up. And we have certainly learned a lot about coding, community, and organizational politics over the last five years.</description>

That is community management.&#xA;Karen Chu has handled community management for Helm since the project was first announced at the inaugural KubeCon in San Francisco.</description>

      <description>Part of the process for Helm to become a graduated CNCF project is to complete an independent and third party security audit with the results being published. As part of the audit of Helm 3 a security issue was found that also impacts Helm v2. Cure53 performed the audit and found the issue. More about the audit will be covered in a future post.&#xA;The vulnerability found impacts all versions of Helm between Helm &amp;gt;=2.</description>

      <description>Helm 2.15.0 was released last week. The 2.15.0 release of Helm introduces several improvements to helm test. Several commands - helm search, helm repo list, and helm install - received the --output flag for machine-readable output.&#xA;In addition to these new features (and many more!), many bugs and edge cases in Helm continue to fixed by members of the community. Several parts of the codebase have been refactored for easier maintainability, usability, and better testing.</description>

      <description>One of the most important parts of upgrading to a new major release of Helm is the migration of data. This is especially true of Helm v2 to v3 considering the architectural changes between the releases. This is where the helm-2to3 plugin comes in.&#xA;It helps with this migration by supporting:&#xA;Migration of Helm v2 configuration. Migration of Helm v2 releases. Clean up Helm v2 configuration, release data and Tiller deployment.</description>

      <description>Helm v3 development has hit a new milestone with the release of the first beta. This is an especially important milestone because it is the end of the effort to refactor Helm v3. The last of the intended breaking changes has landed. From this point on, Helm v3 is focused on bug fixes, stability, and preparing it for a stable release.&#xA;If you are interested in Helm v3 now is a great time to test it out.</description>

      <description>The Helm Client has long been available to download from Google Cloud Storage at the bucket https://kubernetes-helm.storage.googleapis.com. This bucket in Google Cloud has been used by Helm since before Kubernetes was part of the CNCF. The first release hosted on this bucket was Helm v2.0.0-alpha.5!&#xA;Google has long been gracious in providing funding for this location. Since Helm started using it, Helm (as part of Kubernetes) moved into the CNCF, and then moved out from under the Kubernetes umbrella, becoming a sister project to Kubernetes within the CNCF.</description>

      <description>This is the seventh and final part of our Helm 3 Preview: Charting Our Future blog series. Read our previous blog post on library charts here.&#xA;Helm 3.0.0-alpha.1 is the foundation upon which we&#39;ll begin to build the next version of Helm. The features shared over the last few weeks were some of the big promises we made for Helm 3. Many of those features are still in their early stages and that is OK; the idea of an alpha release is to test out an idea, gather feedback from early adopters, and validate those assumptions.</description>

      <description>This is part 6 of 7 of our Helm 3 Preview: Charting Our Future blog series on library charts. You can find our previous blog post on the Helm chart dependencies here.&#xA;Helm 3 supports a class of chart called a &amp;quot;library chart&amp;quot;. This is a chart that is shared by other charts, but does not create any release artifacts of its own. A library chart&#39;s templates can only declare define elements.</description>

      <description>On October 15th, 2015, the project now known as Helm was born. Only one year later, the Helm community joined the Kubernetes organization as Helm 2 was fast approaching. In June 2018, the Helm community joined the CNCF as an incubating project. Fast forward to today, and Helm 3 is nearing its first alpha release.&#xA;In this series of seven blog posts over the next four weeks, I&#39;ll provide some history on Helm&#39;s beginnings, illustrate how we got where we are today, showcase some of the new features available for the first alpha release of Helm 3, and explain how we move forward from here.</description>

A specially crafted chart could be uploaded that caused the uploaded archive to be saved outside of the intended location.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When ChartMuseum is configured for multitenancy the specially crafted chart could be uploaded to one tenant but saved in the location of another tenant. This includes overwriting a chart at a version in the other tenant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if ChartMuseum is configured to use a file system the uploaded Chart archive may be uploaded to locations outside of the storage directory. It could be uploaded to any place the ChartMuseum application binary has write permission to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are unaware of any public exploits caused by this issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Helm was designed with many distributed repositories in mind. Like Homebrew Taps and Debian APT repositories, Helm has the ability to add and work with many repositories. While the Helm &#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/helm/charts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;stable and incubator repositories&lt;/a&gt; have been front and center from the beginning it was never our intent for these to be the only public repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, we are delighted to announce the launch of the &#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.helm.sh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Helm Hub&lt;/a&gt;. This hub provides a means for you to find charts hosted in many distributed repositories hosted by numerous people and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That testing has grown and improved a significant amount in the past year; from Helm linting and testing if an application runs in a cluster to now include YAML linting, some validation on maintainers, &lt;code&gt;Chart.yaml&lt;/code&gt; schema validation, tests on chart version increments, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Governance And Elections</title>
      <link>https://jaymz1439.github.io/blog/new-gov-and-elections/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://jaymz1439.github.io/blog/new-gov-and-elections/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a top level incubating CNCF project requires having a governance structure to ensure that there is a publicly documented process for making decisions regarding the project and the community. While Helm was under Kubernetes, we relied on Kubernetes governance. As part of the transition to CNCF, the Helm project is required to have its own governance structure. To handle this we set up a &#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/helm/community/blob/aa0586011786dfbc3993e7edd959a841241c96e3/governance/provisional-governance.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;provisional governance&lt;/a&gt; with a goal of creating a long term one. After a few months we are happy to announce that the new governance structure has been written and approved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Helm Moves To DCO</title>

      <guid>https://jaymz1439.github.io/blog/helm-dco/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Helm was part of the Kubernetes project it, like the rest of Kubernetes, used the &#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cncf/cla&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CNCF Contributor License Agreement (CLA)&lt;/a&gt;. This served Helm well for years. But, most of the CNCF projects use a &#xD;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developercertificate.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Developers Certificate of Origin (DCO)&lt;/a&gt; instead of a CLA. The exceptions are Kubernetes and gRPC. Upon Helm becoming a CNCF project itself we were asked if we wanted to move Helm to a DCO. After some careful consideration and a little research, the Helm maintainers voted to move to a DCO.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
